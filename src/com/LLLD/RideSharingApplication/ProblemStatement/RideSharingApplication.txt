Design a Ride sharing Application.

Driver can offer rides (Origin,Destination,No of Seats).
Rider can request rides (Origin,Destination,No of Seats).

Ride Amount calculation :

1. When the rides close,show the amount charged to the rider.
2. Ride Amount if No of seats >=2 : No of Kilometers * No of Seats * 0.75 * amount charged per KM.
3. Ride Amount if No of seats =1 : No of Kilometers * amount charged per KM.

The program should take as input two or more drivers and a set of riders requesting rides. Multiple rides can happen simultaneously.

Assumptions :

1. Assume Amount charged per KM :20.
2. No of Kilometers=destination - origin.
3. All values are integer

test case 1 :

Rider  :R1
I/P : 50 60 1
O/P : 10 * 20 = 200 Rs


test case 2 :

Rider  :R2
I/P : 50 60 2
O/P : 10*2*0.75*20 = 300 Rs

Bonus  :

1. Upgrade the rider to a preferred rider if he has done in more than 10 rides.
2. Preferred rider amount if no of seats >=2 : No of kilo * no of seats * 0.5 * amount per KM.
3. Preferred rider amount if no of seats =1 : No of kilo * 0.75 * amount per KM.

Functionalities Expected :

1. Add Driver(name)
2. Add Rider(name)
3. Create a Ride(id,origin,destination,no of seats)
4. Create/Update a Ride(id,origin,destination,no of seats)
5. Withdraw ride(id)
5. Close ride and return ride amount charged.
